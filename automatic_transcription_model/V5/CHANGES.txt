1. eliminated last segments of every audio recording that were shorter than the others instead of padding them to 0s
# 2. added overlap segments, for the notes that could cross segment boundaries
3. removed resizing on dataset creation
4. created newer architecture with vertical dependencies layer for harmonical detection (chords)
5. added plots for metrics visualization
